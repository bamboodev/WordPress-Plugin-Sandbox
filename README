This is a project for learning about WordPress plugin creation. It really isn't ready for public use, but I am using this an opportunity to learn about github as well, so I guess this means the public has access to it? I am not sure.

Be careful: I don't know how to use github that well, and the Wordpress plugin WILL alter your wordpress database. This is a sandbox app, and there be dragons in the sand. BE CAREFUL!
